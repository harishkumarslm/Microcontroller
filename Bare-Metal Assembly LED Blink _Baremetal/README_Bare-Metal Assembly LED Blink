## LED Blink on PA5 (Nucleo-F446RE) - STM32F446RE Assembly Example

### Overview
This project demonstrates a bare-metal assembly implementation to blink the green LED connected to PA5 on the STM32F446RE microcontroller (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE board). The code uses ARM Cortex-M4 assembly language with the Keil uVision IDE, running at a 16 MHz HSI clock. It toggles the LED approximately every 500ms using a simple delay loop, serving as an educational example for learning low-level embedded programming in assembly.

### Hardware Requirements
- **Microcontroller**: STM32F446RE (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE development board).
- **Connections**: No additional wiring is needed; the green LED is internally connected to PA5 (active-high).
- **Tools**:
  - IDE: Keil uVision (v5.24a or later) with ARM compiler.
  - Debugger: ST-Link (integrated with Nucleo board) for flashing and debugging.
  - Optional: Oscilloscope or multimeter to verify PA5 voltage toggling.

### Software Requirements
- Keil uVision with STM32F4 support and ARM assembler.
- CMSIS: Include `startup_stm32f446xx.s` for the vector table (provided by STM32CubeF4).
- No additional libraries are required beyond the assembler.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. **Code Structure**
- **Reset Handler (`Reset_Handler`)**:
  - Entry point after reset, executed first.
  - Enables the GPIOA clock by setting bit 0 in `RCC_AHB1ENR`.
  - Configures PA5 as an output by setting bit 10 in `GPIOA_MODER`.
  - Jumps to `main_loop` for LED toggling.
- **Main Loop (`main_loop`)**:
  - Sets PA5 high (LED on) using `GPIOA_BSRR` with `PA5_SET`.
  - Calls `delay` for ~500ms.
  - Sets PA5 low (LED off) using `GPIOA_BSRR` with `PA5_RESET`.
  - Calls `delay` again.
  - Loops back to `main_loop`.
- **Delay Function (`delay`)**:
  - Loads `DELAY_COUNT` (0x000F4240) into R2.
  - Decrements R2 in a loop until zero, approximating a 500ms delay at 16 MHz.
  - Returns to the caller with `BX LR`.
- **Operation**: The LED toggles on and off every ~500ms, resulting in a ~1 Hz blink rate.

#### 2. **Setup Instructions**
- **Project Configuration**:
  1. Open Keil uVision and create a new project targeting STM32F446RE.
  2. Add the provided assembly code to a `.s` file (e.g., `led_blink.s`).
  3. Include the CMSIS startup file (`startup_stm32f446xx.s`) from STM32CubeF4 for the vector table.
  4. Configure the target options (e.g., 16 MHz HSI clock, no optimization for clarity).
- **Build and Flash**:
  1. Assemble the project (resolve any errors, e.g., missing startup file).
  2. Connect the ST-Link debugger (via the Nucleo’s USB).
  3. Flash the binary to the microcontroller using Keil’s debug interface.
- **Verification**:
  1. Power on the Nucleo board; the green LED (PA5) should blink at ~1 Hz.
  2. Optionally, use an oscilloscope to confirm PA5 toggles between 0V and 3.3V.

#### 3. **Expected Behavior**
- The green LED on the Nucleo-F446RE board (connected to PA5) blinks on for ~500ms, off for ~500ms, repeating indefinitely.
- The blink rate is approximate due to the software delay loop.

#### 4. **Troubleshooting**
- **LED Does Not Blink**:
  - Verify the Nucleo board’s power and ST-Link connection.
  - Ensure `RCC_AHB1ENR` bit 0 is set (GPIOA clock enabled).
  - Check `GPIOA_MODER` bits 11:10 are 01 (output mode for PA5).
- **Irregular Blinking**:
  - Confirm the 16 MHz HSI clock; a different clock may require adjusting `DELAY_COUNT`.
  - Ensure no other code or interrupts interfere with the delay loop.
- **Program Hangs**:
  - Debug with a breakpoint at `main_loop` to verify execution flow.
  - Check for stack overflow or misaligned memory (use `ALIGN` directive).

#### 5. **Customization**
- **Change Blink Rate**: Adjust `DELAY_COUNT` (e.g., 0x007A120 for ~250ms, 0x01E8480 for ~1s) and test.
- **Add More LEDs**: Configure additional GPIO pins (e.g., PA6) by extending `GPIOA_MODER` and `GPIOA_BSRR` logic.
- **Precise Timing**: Use a timer (e.g., TIM2) instead of a delay loop for accurate intervals.
- **Debug Output**: Route a status to another GPIO or UART pin (e.g., PA0 for UART4) to monitor execution.

#### 6. **Limitations**
- The delay is approximate and CPU-dependent, not suitable for real-time applications.
- No interrupt support; the code is fully polling-based.
- Single-threaded design; adding features may require careful loop management.
