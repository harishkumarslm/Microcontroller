## UART4 Communication Example for STM32F446RE

### Overview
This project demonstrates a bare-metal implementation of UART4 communication on the STM32F446RE microcontroller (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE board). The code initializes UART4 to transmit the message "Hello" followed by a carriage return and newline (`\r\n`) at a baud rate of 9600, repeating every 10 milliseconds. It uses direct register manipulation without relying on HAL libraries, making it an educational example for learning low-level embedded programming.

### Hardware Requirements
- **Microcontroller**: STM32F446RE (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE development board).
- **Connections**:
  - UART4 TX (PA0) should be connected to a serial-to-USB adapter or the ST-Link virtual COM port (if supported by the board) for monitoring output.
  - Ensure a common ground between the STM32 board and the serial adapter.
- **Tools**:
  - IDE: Keil uVision (v5.24a or later) or equivalent ARM compiler.
  - CMSIS: Include `stm32f4xx.h` header for register definitions.
  - Serial Terminal: Tera Term, PuTTY, or similar, configured for 9600 baud, 8N1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).

### Software Requirements
- ARM GCC compiler or Keil uVision with STM32F4 support.
- STM32CubeMX (optional) for initial project setup, though not used here.
- Debug tools (e.g., ST-Link debugger) for flashing and verification.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. **Code Structure**
- **Main Function (`main`)**:
  - Initializes a character array `message[] = "Hello\r\n"` (7 characters).
  - Enters an infinite loop, sending each character of the message via `UART4_write` and adding a 10ms delay between transmissions using `delayMs`.
- **Initialization Function (`UART4_init`)**:
  - Enables the GPIOA and UART4 clocks via `RCC->AHB1ENR` and `RCC->APB1ENR`.
  - Configures PA0 as UART4 TX using alternate function 8 (AF8) in `GPIOA->AFR[0]` and sets it to alternate mode in `GPIOA->MODER`.
  - Sets the baud rate to 9600 at 16 MHz clock using `UART4->BRR = 0x0683`.
  - Configures UART4 with 8-bit data, 1 stop bit, no flow control, and enables the transmitter and UART module via `UART4->CR1`.
- **Write Function (`UART4_write`)**:
  - Waits for the transmit buffer to be empty (`UART4->SR & 0x0080`, TXE bit).
  - Writes the character to `UART4->DR`, masking to 8 bits.
- **Delay Function (`delayMs`)**:
  - Implements a simple busy-wait delay using nested loops, approximating 10ms per call at 16 MHz (2000 iterations per ms).

#### 2. **Setup Instructions**
- **Project Configuration**:
  1. Create a new project in Keil uVision targeting STM32F446RE.
  2. Add the `stm32f4xx.h` header file from the STM32CubeF4 package.
  3. Copy the provided code into a `.c` file (e.g., `main.c`).
  4. Ensure the startup file (`startup_stm32f446xx.s`) is included for vector table setup.
- **Build and Flash**:
  1. Compile the project (ensure no errors).
  2. Connect the ST-Link debugger to the Nucleo board.
  3. Flash the binary to the microcontroller via Keil’s debug interface.
- **Serial Connection**:
  1. Connect PA0 (UART4 TX) to the RX pin of a serial-to-USB adapter.
  2. Open a serial terminal (e.g., Tera Term) and configure it to 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.
  3. Select the appropriate COM port (check Device Manager on Windows or `dmesg` on Linux).

#### 3. **Expected Behavior**
- Upon running, the program continuously transmits "Hello" followed by `\r\n` (carriage return and newline) every 10ms.
- The serial terminal should display:
  ```
  Hello
  Hello
  Hello
  ...
  ```
- The 10ms delay creates a noticeable gap between messages, though the exact timing depends on the CPU clock and loop overhead.

#### 4. **Troubleshooting**
- **No Output on Terminal**:
  - Verify PA0 is correctly connected to the serial adapter RX.
  - Ensure the baud rate matches (9600) and the COM port is correct.
  - Check if UART4 clock is enabled (`RCC->APB1ENR bit 18`).
- **Garbled Text**:
  - Confirm the clock source (16 MHz HSI) and recalculate `UART4->BRR` if using a different clock (e.g., PLL).
  - Ensure 8N1 settings match on the terminal.
- **Program Hangs**:
  - Debug using a breakpoint in `UART4_write` to check if `TXE` is never set (indicating clock or configuration issues).
  - Verify `stm32f4xx.h` includes correct register definitions.

#### 5. **Customization**
- **Change Message**: Modify `message[]` to any string (ensure null termination if needed).
- **Adjust Baud Rate**: Update `UART4->BRR` (e.g., 0x0341 for 19200 baud at 16 MHz) and match the terminal.
- **Precise Timing**: Replace `delayMs` with a timer-based delay (e.g., using TIM2) for accurate intervals.

#### 6. **Limitations**
- The delay is approximate and CPU-dependent, not suitable for real-time applications.
- No error handling for UART transmission (e.g., overrun, noise).
- Single-threaded, blocking design; interrupts are not used.
