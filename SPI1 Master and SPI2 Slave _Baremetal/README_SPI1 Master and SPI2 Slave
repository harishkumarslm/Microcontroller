## SPI1 Master to SPI2 Slave Communication Example for STM32F446RE

### Overview
This project implements a bare-metal SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication example on the STM32F446RE microcontroller (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE board), where SPI1 acts as the master and SPI2 as the slave. The master sends a byte starting from 0x55, and the slave responds by incrementing the received byte by 1. The communication occurs in full-duplex mode using software-controlled NSS (Slave Select) on PA4. The code uses direct register manipulation and includes a delay loop for pacing the transmission, making it an educational tool for understanding SPI protocols in embedded systems.

### Hardware Requirements
- **Microcontroller**: STM32F446RE (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE development board).
- **Connections**:
  - SPI1 Master (PA5: SCK, PA6: MISO, PA7: MOSI, PA4: NSS) to SPI2 Slave (PB13: SCK, PB14: MISO, PB15: MOSI, PB12: NSS).
  - Connect PA5 to PB13 (SCK), PA7 to PB15 (MOSI), PA6 to PB14 (MISO), and PA4 to PB12 (NSS) using jumper wires.
  - Ensure no external pull-ups or additional hardware unless debugging with a logic analyzer.
- **Tools**:
  - IDE: Keil uVision (v5.24a or later) or equivalent ARM compiler.
  - CMSIS: Include `stm32f4xx.h` header for register definitions.
  - Debug Tools: ST-Link debugger for flashing, optional oscilloscope/logic analyzer for signal verification.

### Software Requirements
- ARM GCC compiler or Keil uVision with STM32F4 support.
- STM32CubeMX (optional) for initial project setup, though not used here.
- Serial terminal or logic analyzer (optional) for monitoring SPI data if routed to UART or GPIO pins.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. **Code Structure**
- **Main Function (`main`)**:
  - Enables clocks for GPIOA, GPIOB, SPI1, and SPI2 via `RCC` registers.
  - Configures SPI1 as master (PA5, PA6, PA7, PA4) and SPI2 as slave (PB13, PB14, PB15, PB12) with alternate function 5 (AF5).
  - Initializes `master_tx` with 0x55 and enters an infinite loop, calling `spi1_master_write_read` to send and receive data, and `spi2_slave_read_write` to process and respond.
  - Includes a delay loop (`1000000` iterations) to pace transmissions.
- **Master Function (`spi1_master_write_read`)**:
  - Lowers NSS (PA4) to select the slave.
  - Waits for the transmit buffer to be empty (`TXE`, bit 1 of `SPI1->SR`).
  - Sends data via `SPI1->DR` and waits for reception (`RXNE`, bit 0 of `SPI1->SR`).
  - Reads the received data into `rx_data` and waits for the bus to be idle (`BSY`, bit 7 of `SPI1->SR`).
  - Raises NSS to deselect the slave.
- **Slave Function (`spi2_slave_read_write`)**:
  - Waits for received data (`RXNE` in `SPI2->SR`).
  - Reads the received byte into `rx_data`.
  - Waits for the transmit buffer to be empty (`TXE`).
  - Sends `rx_data + 1` via `SPI2->DR` and returns the original received data.
- **Operation**: The master sends a byte (e.g., 0x55), the slave receives it, increments it (e.g., to 0x56), and sends it back. The master reads this response, and `master_tx` increments for the next cycle.

#### 2. **Setup Instructions**
- **Project Configuration**:
  1. Create a new project in Keil uVision targeting STM32F446RE.
  2. Add the `stm32f4xx.h` header from the STM32CubeF4 package.
  3. Copy the provided code into a `.c` file (e.g., `main.c`).
  4. Include the startup file (`startup_stm32f446xx.s`) for vector table setup.
- **Build and Flash**:
  1. Compile the project (resolve any errors, e.g., missing headers).
  2. Connect the ST-Link debugger to the Nucleo board.
  3. Flash the binary to the microcontroller via Keil’s debug interface.
- **Hardware Setup**:
  1. Wire PA5 to PB13, PA7 to PB15, PA6 to PB14, and PA4 to PB12.
  2. Power the board and ensure no short circuits.
- **Verification**:
  1. Use a logic analyzer or oscilloscope to monitor SCK (PA5/PB13), MOSI (PA7/PB15), and MISO (PA6/PB14) to confirm data transfer.
  2. Optionally, route `master_rx` or `slave_rx` to a GPIO or UART pin for debugging output.

#### 3. **Expected Behavior**
- The master sends a byte (starting at 0x55) to the slave.
- The slave receives it, increments it by 1, and sends it back.
- The master reads the incremented value, and the process repeats with `master_tx` increasing (e.g., 0x55 → 0x56 → 0x57...).
- The delay loop (~1 second) spaces out transmissions, observable as periodic SPI activity.

#### 4. **Troubleshooting**
- **No Communication**:
  - Verify all pin connections (PA5→PB13, PA7→PB15, PA6→PB14, PA4→PB12).
  - Ensure SPI clocks are enabled (`RCC->APB2ENR` bit 12, `RCC->APB1ENR` bit 14).
  - Check `SPI1->CR1` and `SPI2->CR1` configurations (master/slave mode, enable bit).
- **Incorrect Data**:
  - Confirm SPI mode (CPOL=0, CPHA=0) matches on both SPI1 and SPI2 (default here).
  - Verify `fck/8` baud rate aligns with the clock (16 MHz HSI).
- **Program Hangs**:
  - Debug with a breakpoint in `spi1_master_write_read` or `spi2_slave_read_write` to check `TXE`, `RXNE`, or `BSY` flags.
  - Ensure no bus contention (e.g., miswired NSS).

#### 5. **Customization**
- **Change Data**: Modify `master_tx` initial value or increment logic in `spi2_slave_read_write`.
- **Adjust Baud Rate**: Change `SPI1->CR1` bits 3:2 (e.g., 0 for fck/2, 3 for fck/16) and test with a logic analyzer.
- **Precise Timing**: Replace the delay loop with a timer (e.g., TIM2) for accurate intervals.
- **Debug Output**: Add UART (e.g., UART4 on PA0) to print `master_rx` or `slave_rx` values.

#### 6. **Limitations**
- The delay is approximate and CPU-dependent, not suitable for real-time applications.
- No interrupt-based communication; uses polling, which may block the system.
- Software NSS control requires careful timing to avoid bus conflicts.
